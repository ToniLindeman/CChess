This is a project made for a school course.
It is written in C and the goal is to make a fully featured chess game. This program is meant to be run in a console.

CChess is developed on Raspberry OS, building it for some other OS may require tweaking the code.
There are some features, like game playback, which I intend to develop after the course is completed. 

Note! The commits are from a later version of the program. It was originally in a larger git repository with all exercises for the aforementioned school course.
I didn't want to make the code for all those exercises public so I made a git repo just for this project.
