| C-Chess is a simple implementation of chess in C-language.    |
| There is no computer player, either you play against yourself |
| or a friend.                                                  |
|                                                               |
| Scenario builder lets you build a chess scenario, and then    |
| run it. You can save up to three scenarios.                   |
|                                                               |
| You have the option to save and exit a game. The game can     |
| then be loaded at a later time.                               |
|                                                               |
| Player one (white) is on top, and player two on the bottom    |
| (black). Each player's chess pieces are marked with a number. |
| 1 for white and 2 for black.                                  |
|                                                               |
